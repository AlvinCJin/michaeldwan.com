My name is Michael Dwan. I'm a software designer and developer living in Boulder Colorado. I build things I find useful. Usually for consumers. Almost always for humans.

I'm married to [Adriana](https://twitter.com/adrianaology), the most wonderful person in the world. She makes the best pies. She also makes cute children, the first of which we've named Am√©lie. We have two housemates. Both cats. Both behind on rent.

I like cycling, hiking, travel, and long walks, preferably on a beach. I'm alright at photography. I sometimes moonlight as an amateur philosopher. But, why?

I was raised in Crown Point, Indiana, a small town just outside Chicago. Growing up, I spent my days daydreaming through school and my nights thinking Java was the best thing since the `<blink>` tag.

When I was 15 I got my first job writing training software for one of the first voice recognition systems. I also built my fare share of e-commerce sites, including one that actually held multi-million dollar auctions for violins. It was the first bubble after all.

I studied liberal arts at Purdue University but dropped out to focus on my first company, much to my parents dismay. That company made database software for entertainment & architectural lighting systems. That's when I learned of the "enterprise sales cycle."

Over the next few years, I worked on large scale enterprise, b2b, and media products at various Chicago companies. One of the more fun projects was building the tax calculation backend for the Crate&Barrel point of sale system. You can trace my hatred for basic math back to that experience.

In 2011 I founded Snapjoy with [JP Ren](https://twitter.com/jpren). We attended Y Combinator and had a blast building the world's best photo experience. Dropbox acquired Snapjoy in December 2012. I spent the following 18 months as a bona fide Dropbox product manager working on photos, mobile, and some social stuff.
